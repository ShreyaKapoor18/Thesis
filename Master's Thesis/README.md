# Extracting most predictive subgraphs from models of human brain connectivity
Classification based on graphs derived from MRI scans to identify subregions in the brain that show differences in connectivity between subjects. The goal is to derive the most explanatory subgraph from whole-brain connectivity that has high discriminatory power and also encodes import biological properties
