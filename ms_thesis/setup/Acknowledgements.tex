Completing my master's thesis during an ongoing pandemic was a big challenge, both personally and professionally. It was through the constant support of my supervisors, family and friends that I have been able to complete this thesis. 
First of all, I am very grateful to Prof. Dr. Thomas Schultz for the support and guidance during the course of this thesis. His insights have been valuable for developing a consolidated research plan and viewing the research problem critically. He also made it possible for me to receive a fellowship from the Deutscher Akademiker Austauchdienst (DAAD). I am also very thankful to him for delivering interesting courses that sparked my research interests and stimulated me to research on this topic.

Secondly, I would like to thank Mohammad Khatami for being my day-to-day supervisor and being patient with all my questions. He gave me constant feedback and was immensely helpful in solving implementational problems. I am also indebted to Dr. Regina Wehler whose Master Thesis Research made it easy for me to get started with my research topic. 

I am also thankful to the DAAD and the German Foreign Office (AA) for financially supporting my master's thesis. The financial support made it possible for me to maintain my focus during my project.
