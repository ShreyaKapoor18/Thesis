\chapter{Introduction}
One of the greatest scientific challenges in the $21^{st}$ century is to understand the structure and function of the human brain. How intricate networks of cells organize themselves at different scales and give rise to behaviour, emotion and intelligence has remained an open question in neuroscience since ages. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest to understand the human brain in health and disease. Technological advances are taking humanity closer to answering the question: what makes us, us? 

Research in Neuroscience has greatly benefited from advances in Neuroimaging data acquisition, analysis and retrieval. The decreasing cost of data storage and computational memory resources has lead to development of imaging standards and made wide range studies possible. Increasing efficiency and accuracy of non-invasive imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CT and PET have contributed significantly towards understanding the human brain in health and disease. Among these, MRI is a popular modality due to the diversity of information that can be generated using a single scanner. Each of the four types structural MRI, task-activated functional MRI, Diffusion MRI and Resting state fMRI can be used to carry out different types of research (\cite{van2016human}). 

Excitement from investigators has brought about the progress of ambitious projects such as the Human Connectome Project launched in 2009 (\cite{van2016human}). It explores the research area known as \textit{Connectomics} (previously known as \textit{hodology}), the study of brain's structural and functional networks. Connectomics is aimed at creating a map of the brain divided into functionally and structurally distinct areas known as parcels. Understanding the contribution of connections between regions is important for analyzing the emergent properties of brain structure and function. This framework is also important to understand defects caused due to Neurological disorders as well as emotion and cognition (\cite{sala2015reorganization}). 

Structural brain connectivity is the study of white matter tracts in the brain and can be measured using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Functional connectivity is based on information exchange between different brain regions and can be measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Each of these connectivities have their own importances but DTI based structural connectivity is of special importance in medical applications as it provides insight into anatomical connections in the brain of individual patients, and can aid precision medicine (\cite{cociu2017multimodal}).

Machine Learning has become an indispensable tool in Neuroimaging studies due to \textit{curse of dimensionality}, the number of subjects in the study is often much lesser than the number of features. It has often been used to make predictions based on MRI scans and classify diseased states of patients. However, for the analysis of brain connectivity there is a need for the ML algorithm to understand the topological properties of brain organization. Generic classifiers are not well suited for graph brain networks due to their density and computational complexity. Traditional classifiers suffer from a lack of interpretability and often do not lead to results with neurobiological correspondence (\cite{10.3389/fnagi.2017.00329}). Hence, it is required to incorporate the advantages of graph theoretic methods and machine learning algorithms for making neurobiologically and statistically significant predictions.
